I'm Aidan, but I tend to go by my middle name, Kirby, online or by friends. I'm currently a research scientist at Allegheny General Hospital in robotics and orthopedics.

This site is just a repo for things I find cool or interesting, but I will try to populate this with projects and descriptions of things I've worked on in the past.

Le vent se lève! Il faut tenter de vivre directly means "the wind has risen! we must try to live." It comes from a poem by Paul Valéry titled (in English) "The Wind Rises", but it's also the namesake for Hayao Miyazaki's 2014 film about an aviation engineer's dream to build beautiful airplanes in the wake of the second world war. I hold this phrase close to me as a reminder that challenges are always on the horizon, and one must adapt to the rising tide. This phrase comes up whenever you check the description of my webpages.

I'm Aidan, you can call me Kirby or whatever. I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying mathematical sciences. In my last year of undergraduate, I was introduced to optimal transport by my Bachelors Thesis advisor, William Feldman, and it has been of great interest to me ever since. In particular, the applications to the calculus of variations through gradient flow theory. I'll update my interests as they evolve over time.

In general, I plan to use this website as a personal repository for things I'm interested in both academically and personally. I'll have tabs for math posts I find cool as well as posts for my hobbies and interests. 

Moreover, "Catamay" is a shortening of the phrase "Cataclysmic Mayflies" which I came up with in early middle school because I found the insect quite interesting.
